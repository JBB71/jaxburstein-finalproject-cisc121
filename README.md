# Algorithm - Quick Sort
This program is an user friendly and interactive app that teaches people what the main idea of a quick sort algorithm is. Instead of the program just sorting a list or array by itself, the user chooses which numbers are greater, equal, or less than the chosen pivot. The program will give feedback, show the correct partitions for the user to be able to learn from their mistakes, and helps the user until the list/array is fully sorted.

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)
Decomposition:
 - Take in a random list of elements
 - Choose a pivot point at random
 - Ask the user whether a number in the unsorted array is part of the left (less than) or right (greater than) partition
 - If the user is correct then tell them and append their choice into the new list
 - If user is wrong tell them why and tell them to try again
 - Display the final sorted list and tell user how accurate they were
Pattern Recognition:
 - Select pivots each time
 - Compare elements to the pivot
 - Partition into left and right subarrays
Abstraction:
 - To not overwhelm the user:
   - Only display the pivot and one element
   - Only offer left or right as an option for the user
